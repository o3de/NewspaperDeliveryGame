# Newspaper Delivery Game Demo Project

**Project Description:**   
The player takes the role of a newspaper delivery kid who, within a vast fictional 3D world, delivers newspapers to customerâ€™s homes within a set time limit. If all deliveries are made before the timer expires, the player will be allowed to progress on to the next level.
